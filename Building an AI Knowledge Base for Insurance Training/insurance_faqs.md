# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Product FAQs

### Life Insurance FAQs

1. **What is term insurance?**
   Term insurance is a pure protection plan that provides life coverage for a specific period. It pays the sum assured to the nominee only if the insured person dies during the policy term. It has no maturity benefit if the insured survives the term.

2. **What is the difference between term insurance and whole life insurance?**
   Term insurance provides coverage for a specific period (like 20 or 30 years), while whole life insurance provides coverage for the entire lifetime (typically up to age 99 or 100). Term insurance is more affordable but has no maturity benefit, while whole life insurance is more expensive but builds cash value over time.

3. **How much life insurance coverage do I need?**
   A general rule is to have coverage of at least 10-15 times your annual income. However, the exact amount depends on factors like your age, income, dependents, existing liabilities, future financial goals, and inflation.

4. **What is a ULIP?**
   Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) is a product that offers both insurance protection and investment opportunities. Part of the premium goes toward life coverage, while the rest is invested in market-linked funds chosen by the policyholder.

5. **What happens if I stop paying premiums on my life insurance policy?**
   If you stop paying premiums, your policy will enter a grace period (typically 15-30 days). If payment isn't made during this period, the policy may lapse. Some policies with accumulated cash value may continue with reduced benefits or automatically convert to paid-up status with reduced sum assured.

6. **Can I revive my lapsed life insurance policy?**
   Yes, most life insurance policies can be revived within a specific period (usually 2-5 years from the date of lapse) by paying all outstanding premiums with interest and possibly undergoing medical tests, depending on the revival period and company policy.

7. **What is a free look period?**
   The free look period is a window (typically 15-30 days from receiving the policy document) during which you can review your policy and return it if you're not satisfied. The insurer will refund the premium paid, deducting charges for insurance cover, medical examination, and stamp duty.

8. **What is a nomination in life insurance?**
   Nomination is the process of appointing someone (nominee) to receive the policy benefits in case of the policyholder's death. The nominee acts as a trustee and is legally bound to distribute the proceeds to the legal heirs.

### Health Insurance FAQs

1. **What is a pre-existing disease in health insurance?**
   A pre-existing disease is any condition, ailment, or injury that exists before the policy start date. Most health insurance policies cover pre-existing diseases after a waiting period of 2-4 years.

   - Maternity waiting period: 2-4 years

3. **What is the difference between cashless and reimbursement claims?**
   In cashless claims, the insurer directly settles the hospital bill with the network hospital. You don't need to pay upfront except for non-medical expenses or items not covered by the policy. In reimbursement claims, you pay the hospital bills first and then claim reimbursement from the insurer by submitting the required documents.

4. **What is a network hospital?**
   A network hospital is a hospital that has a tie-up with your health insurance provider or TPA (Third Party Administrator). At network hospitals, you can avail cashless treatment, where the insurer directly settles the bill with the hospital.

   Sub-limits are caps on specific expenses within the overall sum insured. Common sub-limits include room rent (e.g., 1% of sum insured per day), specific treatments, doctor fees, or ambulance charges.

7. **What is a co-payment in health insurance?**
   Co-payment is a cost-sharing requirement where the policyholder must pay a specific percentage of the claim amount (typically 10-20%), while the insurer pays the rest. Co-payment is common in senior citizen policies or for treatment in high-cost hospitals.

8. **What is a family floater health insurance policy?**
   A family floater policy covers multiple family members (typically spouse, children, and sometimes parents) under a single sum insured. The sum insured can be used by any or all family members during the policy year, making it more cost-effective than individual policies.

### Motor Insurance FAQs

1. **What is the difference between third-party and comprehensive motor insurance?**
   Third-party insurance only covers damages caused by your vehicle to third-party person, property, or vehicle. It doesn't cover damages to your own vehicle.

7. **Can I transfer my NCB when I sell my car and buy a new one?**
   Yes, NCB belongs to you, not the vehicle. You can transfer your NCB when you sell your car and buy a new one. You need to obtain an NCB reservation letter from your current insurer and submit it to the new insurer within 90 days.
